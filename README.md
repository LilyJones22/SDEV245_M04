Midterm: Build a Secure Data Transmission App with Hashing and Encryption

<p>This simluation upholds confidentiality by making sure that the key must be entered before the message is recieved, assuring that only the people who should be able to open the message do. It upholds integrity via hashing, and the hashed end message can be traced back to make sure it was unaltered. And availability is there because there isn't a really a way for it to be overloaded at this time</p>
<p>Entropy is ensured by using an encrpytion standard that has been the standard choice by many. Key generation itself is used to make sure that only the person with the key is able to access the message</p>
